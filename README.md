The coding standards that I have learned and implemented in this exercise are readability, reliability and reusability. By using a UUID for product id's during product creation, the program becomes more reliable and secure because the id's are unique and not simply enumerated by incrementing the value. This also helps the product become more reusable when implementing editing and deletion because we can simply fetch the UUID of the product that we want to edit/delete. I also did my best to make the code readable by putting simple, descriptive names for the variables. In addition, I keep the formatting consistent with the same amount of coding style and indentation. The functions are also kept short and concise so that they only focus on a single task.
